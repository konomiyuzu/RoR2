## Known Issues
* ``If Trophy hunter is added to the pool and is rolled, it will replace your equipment with the consumed version of trophy hunter regardless of your equipment``

there is an experimental patch for which may break mods that modifiy the tricorn

* ``If 2 modded equipment somehow have the exact same name, capitalization, spacing and special characters the mod will ignore whichever one loads slower``

though if this were to happen you can still select them via equipment index as that cannot be the same

## Planned features
* ~~Maybe a way to view the equipment name/internal name/index of modded equipments~~ ðŸ—¸ implemented 
* ~~Special characters (such as ') insensitivity~~ ðŸ—¸ implemented
