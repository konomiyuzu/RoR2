Allows for full customization of the Bottled Chaos equipment pool via config file

## Config guide
### Input

The Config can accept the name, internal name or the index of the equipment  
you can find the names, internal names and indexes of all equipments [here](https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/Item-&-Equipment-IDs-and-Names)  
>**for example** : 0, Disposable Missle Launcher, DroneBackup

## Mod Compatibility
as said above this mod should be compatible with other mods as long as you can get the name/internal name/equipment index

you can find those by enabling "Give Equipment Info" then looking at the log file.

### Step by step guide

1. Enable Give Equipment Info
2. Launch the game, Then in BepInEx Enable Developer Tools in Settings
3. In Console Search for "CustomChaosPool"
4. Wait for "Equipment Info" to pop up
5. Double click on "Equipment Info" and search for what ever equipment you want there

I hope this is easy enough to understand to a non mod developer ^v^

## Known Issues
* If Trophy hunter is added to the pool and is rolled, it will replace your equipment with the consumed version of trophy hunter regardless of your equipment 

I might fix this if i ever feel motivated to (persumably by having a run ruined by it)

## Planned features
* ~~Maybe a way to view the equipment name/internal name/index of modded equipments~~ ðŸ—¸ implemented 
* Special characters (such as ') insensitivity
